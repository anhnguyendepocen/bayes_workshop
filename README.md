# Workshop on Bayesian Statistics

This repo contains all materials for the workshop presented at the 29th EFPSA congress and held by Fabian Dablander and Peter Edelsbrunner.
In **slides/** you will find the presentation written in Rmarkdown. The slides are webpage, so just open **bayes_slides.html** with your browser! **literature/** features a commented literature review of some 60 papers concerning the General Linear Model, Frequentist Statistics, Bayesian Statistics, Statistical Power, and the Replication Crisis. Code for demonstration and analysis
are to be found in **code/**, while the various datasets are in **data/**.

## preparation
If you have never heard of Bayesian inference and / or the replication crisis in psychology, I suggest
reading [these](http://ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/BayesianAnalysisEnclopedia.pdf) [two](http://ejwagenmakers.com/2008/BayesFreqBook.pdf) excellent articles. Further, check out

## what now? (Science 2.0)
After you've checked out the slides, I suggest you register on twitter and follow [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](https://twitter.com/EJWagenmakers), [Richard Morey](https://twitter.com/richarddmorey), [Jeff Rouder](https://twitter.com/JeffRouder), [Daniel Lakens](https://twitter.com/lakens), [Alexander Etz](https://twitter.com/AlxEtz), [Joe Hilgard](https://twitter.com/JoeHilgard). By following their conversations, you quickly find other interesting people. Twitter is a blast!

Science is changing, and blogs are an excellent way to get your information and stay up to date. I suggest you follow the blogs by [Daniel Lakens](http://daniellakens.blogspot.nl/), [Richard Morey](http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/), [Jeff Rouder](http://jeffrouder.blogspot.de/), [John Kruschke](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.de/), [Alexander Etz](http://alexanderetz.com/), and the publication page of [EJ Wagenmakers](http://ejwagenmakers.com/papers.html).

As for papers to read, just check out the literature list in **literature/**. The title and comments are a good indicator; pick whatever you find interesting. For "immediately afterwards reads" I would recommend 

- Bayesian t-test for accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis, [here](http://pcl.missouri.edu/jeff/sites/pcl.missouri.edu.jeff/files/Rouder.etal_.pbr_.2009.pdf)

- Model Comparison and the principle of parsimony, [here](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/VandekerckhoveEtAlinpress.pdf) 

- Default Bayes factors for model selection in regression, [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00273171.2012.734737#)

In terms of books, I recommend the practical one by Michael Lee and EJ Wagenmakers, see [here](http://bayesmodels.com/). A rather verbose, but extensive one is Kruschke's [new one](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/). For a concise one, check [Kaplan](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Statistics-Social-Sciences-Methodology/dp/1462516513). Jackman's [book](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Analysis-Social-Sciences-Jackman/dp/0470011548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432129710&sr=8-1&keywords=Bayesian+analysis+for+the+social+sciences) is a little heavier on the math, but very extensive with excellent examples. For likelihoods, see Royall's [classic](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9780412044113).

## data
The data for the exercises are either in JASP itself, or from [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-Ww24m3ZkEyLS1MbUdfQ1VZRXc/edit); courtesy of [Wagenmakers](https://sites.google.com/site/erasmusmathpsych/2015-seminar/materials/bayesian-inference).
