# Workshops on Bayesian statistics

This repository contains all materials (slides, code, data, reading list) for workshops on Bayesian statistics
that Peter Edelsbrunner and I have given. Each repository has a specific README file. If you have any questions, want to
use any of the materials, or think some things are wrong, drop me an email or create an issue.
