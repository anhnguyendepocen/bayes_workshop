# Workshop on Bayesian Statistics [under construction!]
## Note
This workshop is in progress. Because github is a great collaborative tool, and we do not want to make this repo private because of the last workshop, it's public. Bear this in mind!

This repo contains all materials for the workshop presented at the 4th EFPSA congress and held by Peter Edelsbrunner and Fabian Dablander. In **slides/** you will find the presentation written in Rmarkdown. The slides are webpage, so just open **bayes_slides.html** with your browser! Code for demonstration and analysis are to be found in **code/**, while the various datasets are in **data/**.

## preparation
Please read the recent blog post on the JEPS bulletin about [Bayesian statistics](http://blog.efpsa.org/2015/08/03/bayesian-statistics-why-and-how/). 

## what now? (Science 2.0)
After you've checked out the slides, I suggest you register on twitter and follow [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](https://twitter.com/EJWagenmakers), [Richard Morey](https://twitter.com/richarddmorey), [Jeff Rouder](https://twitter.com/JeffRouder), [Daniel Lakens](https://twitter.com/lakens), [Alexander Etz](https://twitter.com/AlxEtz), [Joe Hilgard](https://twitter.com/JoeHilgard). By following their conversations, you quickly find other interesting people. Twitter is a blast!

Science is changing, and blogs are an excellent way to get your information and stay up to date. I suggest you follow the blogs by [Daniel Lakens](http://daniellakens.blogspot.nl/), [Richard Morey](http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/), [Jeff Rouder](http://jeffrouder.blogspot.de/), [John Kruschke](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.de/), [Alexander Etz](http://alexanderetz.com/), and the publication page of [EJ Wagenmakers](http://ejwagenmakers.com/papers.html).

As for papers to read, just check out the literature list in **../literature/**. The title and comments are a good indicator; pick whatever you find interesting. For "immediately afterwards reads" I would recommend 

- Model Comparison and the principle of parsimony, [here](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/VandekerckhoveEtAlinpress.pdf) 

- Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics (plus commentaries), [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bmsp.2013.66.issue-1/issuetoc)

- Default Bayes factors for model selection in regression, [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00273171.2012.734737#)

In terms of books, I recommend the practical one by Michael Lee and EJ Wagenmakers, see [here](http://bayesmodels.com/). A rather verbose, but extensive one is Kruschke's [new one](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/). For a concise one, check [Kaplan](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Statistics-Social-Sciences-Methodology/dp/1462516513). Jackman's [book](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Analysis-Social-Sciences-Jackman/dp/0470011548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432129710&sr=8-1&keywords=Bayesian+analysis+for+the+social+sciences) is a little heavier on the math, but very extensive with excellent examples. In similar spirit is [Gill (2015)](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Methods-Behavioral-Sciences-Statistics/dp/1439862486/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438966387&sr=8-1&keywords=gill+bayesian+methods).

## data
The data for the exercises are either in JASP itself, or from [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-Ww24m3ZkEyLS1MbUdfQ1VZRXc/edit); courtesy of [Wagenmakers](https://sites.google.com/site/erasmusmathpsych/2015-seminar/materials/bayesian-inference).
